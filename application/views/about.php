	<h2 class="up-case super-header">The Story</h2>
	<p>Forced in the desperation to play video and music. <strong>Youtube-Queue</strong> site is born. </p>
	<p>At some point of my life while my watching video : </p>
		<ul>
			<li>After the video/music is finish </li>
			<li>Search video fro youtube again </li>
			<li>Then play again video </li>
			<li>OK video/music is finish </li>
			<li>Im gonna search again now </li>
			<li>Opps found one, gonna play now </li>
			<li>AND INFINITE TIME PROCESS </li>
		</ul>

	<p>And suddenly, a heavenly voice screamed on me <blockquote><i>"ARE YOU NOT GETTING TIRED OF THIS SHIT? You lazy m****r f****r, find a way to queue the video so you can just queue and queue and queue then after watch all video with no hastle."</i></blockquote></p>

	<p>So I answered, <blockquote><i>Oh please if only <strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/">Youtube</a></strong> has a features to <strong>Queue</strong> or <strong>Add up to next video</strong> then that would be great, but as of now to make it work like that you need to create playlist in youtube and add your videos on it and its freeeeeaking tiring</i></blockquote>

	<p>But the heavenly voice screamed more loadly.<blockquote>THEN BUILD A FREAKING APP TO QUEUE UP VIDEO EASLY.</blockquote>

	<p>And then the wind of productivity blows me in. And after a couples of weeks, TA-DA.</p>
